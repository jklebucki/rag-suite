The first is the import and distribution of fruits and vegetables – Citronex is one of the leading banana importers in Europe, and in modern ripening facilities in Poland and Romania, it prepares over 362,000 cartons of this fruit daily. At the same time, the company runs some of the largest greenhouse tomato crops in Europe with a total area of over 75 ha in Bogatynia, Siechnice, and Ryczywół. Cultivation is carried out all year round using innovative technologies such as LED lighting, natural pollination by bumblebees, or biological plant protection methods, and the offer includes various varieties – from raspberry Tomimaru Muchoo, through cherry and baby plum, to beef and roma. The second pillar of activity is transport, forwarding, and logistics – Citronex has a modern fleet meeting Euro 6 standards, equipped with monitoring and cargo security systems, which allows for timely and safe transports domestically and abroad. Another area is the network of fuel stations under the Dyskont Paliwowy brand, which offer high-quality fuel at attractive prices, and the largest network of ecological TIR car washes for trucks in Poland. An important element of the offer are also Picaro hotels and restaurants, located on major communication routes, including highways A2 and A4, providing comfortable rest and good food for travelers. The entire Citronex activity is characterized by strong industry integration – from agricultural production, through logistics and transport, to retail customer service – and striving for sustainable development, innovation, and high-quality services. Thanks to this, the company is a leader in its industry in Poland and Europe. The IT Director at Citronex is Jarosław Kłębucki."
